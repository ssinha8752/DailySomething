Hint
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
  let len=height.length;
  let max=0;
  for(let i=0;i<len-1;i++)
  {
      for(let j=i+1;j<len;j++)
      { 
          let curr=height[i];
          let next=height[j];
          let area = Math.min(curr, next) * (j - i);
          max = Math.max(max, area);
      }
  }
  return max;  
};
